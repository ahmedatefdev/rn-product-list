# React Native Test Task (Product List Page & Pretend Backend Interaction)

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the React Native test tasks. The tasks and their implementations are outlined below.

## Tasks

### Task #1: Product List Page

- Created a React Native component using TypeScript to display a list of products.
- Each product includes its name, description, and price.
- Fetched data from a pretend backend using a simulated API call (setTimeout or JSON files).
- Implemented a basic search function to help users find products by name.
- Bonus: Added pagination for viewing products in smaller groups.

### Task #2: Pretend Backend Interaction

- Used a method of choice to simulate communication with a backend for Task #1.
- Ensured consistent information presentation across different parts of the app.

## How to Run the App

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedatefdev/rn-product-list
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd rn-product-list
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the app :
     ```bash
     yarn start
     ```
     
### NOTE: make sure to use Node 16 or newer.
